# Localizing RITA

Rita localization is a little unusual - check `en.json` for an example.

You should localize as normal, except for the `commands` object.

In this object, each currently registered command is localized:

```JSON
{
    "...": "...",
    "commands": {
        "listen": [
            "{assistantName}",
            "Hello {assistantName}",
            "OK {assistantName}", 
            "Okay {assistantName}", 
            "Hi {assistantName}"
        ],
        "runCommand": [
            "{assistantName} *phrase",
            "Hello {assistantName} *phrase",
            "OK {assistantName} *phrase", 
            "Okay {assistantName} *phrase", 
            "Hi {assistantName} *phrase"
        ],
        "quietly": "Quietly *phrase",
        "again": "Again",
        "useSpellItem": [
            {"Use *spell":{"verb":"Using"}},
            {"Cast *spell":{"verb":"Casting"}},
            {"Shoot *spell":{"verb":"Shooting"}},
            {"Fire *spell":{"verb":"Firing"}}
        ],
        "getRangeSpellItem":"(What's the) range (of) (on) (my) *spell",
        "...": "..."
    }
}
```

The strings are phrases you speak to Rita in order to run the command.

For example, saying "Rita, again" will run the base `again` command, or saying "Rita, what's the range on Eldritch Blast?" will run `getRangeSpellItem`

# Important differences from regular i18n

## Curly Brackets {}

`{}` can only be used in certain situations. Right now, only the assistants name and the keyword to execute a macro are defined for this. Simply use `{assistantName}` as in `listen` or `runCommand` above to have the assistants name inserted at that point in the string.

## Straight brackets ()

Straight brackets are used to mark optional words in a phrase.

For example, in `getRangeSpellItem`, the user can say "Rita, range Eldritch Blast", or "Rita, What's the range on Eldritch Blast" or "Rita, range on my Eldritch Blast" etc.

## Splats \*

`*` are used to mark a variable passed in using the users voice. If a splat appears in the `en.json` version of a command, it **must** appear in the localized version with the english name.

## New i18n types

Localized strings can be:

* Single strings 
  * see `again` or `quietly` above
* Arrays of strings
  * See `listen` or `runCommand` above
* Arrays of Custom objects
  * See `useSpellItem` above

### Single Strings

If you only want one phrase to map to a command, use a single string.

### String Arrays

If you want the user to be able to phrase things in multiple ways, use a String Array. The user can then speak any of the provided strings to trigger the command.

### Array of Custom Objects

Some commands vary slightly depending on what is said. We use the Custom Object as seen in `useSpellItem` to trigger these with i18n support.

If a string in `en.json` uses a custom object, you should ensure you use the same custom object in your i18n file, replacing the trigger phrases and custom variable results as needed.

Apologies in advance, language is complicated and localization doesn't often match too well back to English, but I've used Google Translate to try and explain a little below.

For example, in `useSpellItem` you might have:

```JSON
"useSpellItem": [
    {"Verwenden *spell":{"verb":"Verwenden von"}},
    {"Feuer *spell":{"verb":"Abfeuern"}}
],
```

`useSpellItem` accepts `spell` to determine which item or spell to use, which is passed through the speech recognition system, and `verb` to determine what Rita should respond with, which is defined here.

You can add or remove as many of these as you need, as long as all of the entries have the same object structure.

Note that `useSpellItem`, `*spell` and `verb` are all still in English in this example, as they are important keywords parsed by the software.
